# Story Pitch 

Addiction is a **multifaceted phenomenon** that Purdue Pharmaceauticals exponentially enabled with the flase promotion of OxyContin as a safe drug for pain management. I will explore the **long term effects of America's opioid epidemic** by illustrating the the impact the rise in opioid perscribing has had on fatal overdoses nationwide. I will begin with a short history on the subject to contexualize the drug, then follow with an analysis of its lasting effects. The Sackler family had used their profit to manipulate US State Attorneys, FDA officials and medical board practitioners. They sold out in exchange for the health of the nation, and I will show how hundreds of thousands of lives were cut short for profit.

# Opioids
Opioids is an all encompassing term referring to natural, semi - synthetic, and synthetic opioids. Opiates are natural opioids, which are directly derived from the extremely addictive latex of the seeds of the Papaver Somniferum, or opium poppies. Examples include heroin, morphine and codeine. Synthetic opioids are chemically made with examples including tramadol and fentanyl. Semi-synthetic opioids land in a gray area in between, kind of like GMOs. Heroin is an example of a semi-synthetic opioid because it is made from morphine, an opiate, but has been chemically processed. Other examples of semi-synthetic opioids include oxycodone, hydrocodone, hydromorphone, and oxymorphone.

# History of Morphine
**Early 1800s**
Morphine was first isolated in the early 17th century by German physicist Friedrich Sertürner. His discovery is often described as the first isolation of a medicinal alkaloid from a plant—no small feat for the field of medicine. Morphine is an opiate. Opiates are natural opioids, directly derived from the extremely addictive latex of the seeds of the Papaver Somniferum, or opium poppies.

**Mid 1800s**
Morphine becomes commercially produced. Hydroponic needles are invented and morphine becomes much easier to administer. Doctors start prescribing more morphine to chronic pain patients; it is utilized at high rates during the civil war to treat soldiers' battle injuries. Morphine addiction is widely recognized by the public 

**Late 1800**
Scientist Alder Wright invented Heroin, a mix of morphine and other chemicals, in hopes for a less addictive painkiller to treat morphine addiction. It wasn’t until years after it had been the go-to doctor prescribed pain killer that it was realized heroin was much more addictive than morphine. 
Early 1900s
By 1914, the government placed their first real ban on the management of opioids with Congress’ passing of the Harrison Narcotics Act. The act regulated and taxed the production, importation and distribution of opioids. Ten years later, the 1924 Heroin Act outlawed all use of heroin. German researchers created Oxycodone from an opioid derivative.

**Mid 1900**
Synthetic and semi-synthetic opioids started to emerge. Morphine’s use to manage pain in clinical practice began to be overtaken by these new semi-synthetic and synthetic opioids that are significantly more powerful.

Morphine is the standard by which pain relievers are measured:

**Late 1900**
Purdue Pharmaceuticals, a pharmaceutical company primarily owned by the Sackler Family, 
introduced OxyContin to the FDA in 1996. Oxycontin was their name brand for oxycodone, a semi-synthetic opioid. Perdue Pharmaceuticals aggressively marketed their drug as the first non-addictive opioid. Purdue Pharmaceuticals engaged in numerous quid-pro-quos with elite officials resulting in a special FDA label for OxyCotin’s approval. This marked the first time the FDA had ever labeled a class II narcotic as “less addictive”. The Sackler family completely fabricated the narrative of OxyContin. Their drug was tested by scientists and recommended by doctors on their payroll. Sales for the drug grew from $48 million in 1996 to almost $1.1 billion in 2000.

**2000**
By 2001, OxyContin was the best-selling narcotic pain reliever in the United States. It continued to be heavily promoted through the first decade of the century even as information about the drug's true addictive nature was uncovered. Eventually, thousands of lawsuits against Perdue Pharmaceauticals and The Sackler family caused the company to declare bankrupcy in 2019. However, OxyCotin is still being overperscribed to patients for moderate pain, and their effects are omnipresent. 


# The Impact of OxyContin
## Opioid related deaths between 1999 and 2015

The first point of reference I will use to assess the impact the approval of OxyContin for pain management has had is through the analysis on the number of opioid related deaths our country has seen since. 


_**Question 1:** How have the number of opioid related deaths changed in the past couple of decades?_

In exploring how long these trends have lasted, I decided to calculate the percent change in opioid overdose deaths between 1999 and 2015 utilizing the data from the CDCs blah blah blah.

**Step 1:** Create a new column to store the percent change values "Insert" --> "Insert Column"
**Step 2:** Create a function to compute percent change

Percent change is found by comparing the difference between the values with the original number:

    Percent Change =  new - old / old * 100


As Purdue Pharma bought a monopoly on America’s pain, citizens were feeling its effects. In the twenty years that followed Purdue Pharma’s introduction of OxyContin into the world, there was a **171% increase in total opioid overdose deaths between 1999 and 2015.** The results are even more jarring when you break it down by age group.


_**Question 2:** What group was the most affected?_

**Step 1:** Apply the percent change formula to all of the cells in the percent change column by clicking & dragging curser to encompass all the data.
**Step 2:** Sort the data based on the percent change column in descending order such that the group with the highest percent change will be listed first
"Data" --> "Sort Sheet" --> "Sort sheet by column (Z-> A)


Females, aged 25 - 34, saw a **1,433.33% increase in opioid related deaths between 1999 and 2015.**

# The Source of the Drugs

_**Question 3:** Where are these drugs coming from?_

I approached this question by first looking at the states which had the highest rates of prescriptions per capita. 


Then I looked at what region these drugs were coming from. 
use VLOOK UP with a key of the states in each geographical region and match that with the data set you have on prescriptions per state -- will find that the south has the most break that down more to the individual states to see which ones get the most

Mention that this is a limitation because its where the doctors wrote the prescription from, not where they were ingested. Thus.. what follows is that where people are actually dying might be different from where they were prescribed. 

_**Question 4:** What do overdose rates look like per state?_

Utilizing data from the CDC's National Center for Health Statistics, I created a choropleth map illustrating the rate of fatal overdoses by state per 100,000 persons. 

![HIGDz-fatal-overdoses-by-state-nbsp- (2)](https://github.com/leahs02/J124-final/assets/117393397/44bc430c-9f60-4584-8027-18125a360b0b)

The darker the state is, the higher the rate is for drug overdoses per capita. West Virginia had the highest rate of fatal overdoses of 90 per 100,000 people dying that year from overdoses. In the area between the midwest and the east coast, this trend of high rates continues as the map darkens all throughout Kentucky and Tennessee with rates of about 56 overdose deaths per 100,000 people. 

What do all of these states have in common? They are all considered to be part of the Appalachian Region. 

**_Question 5:** How are rates per state changing_

According to data the CDC collected in 2019-2020, opioid overdoses are still increasing. Based on rates collected in each year, **there are still 19 states with statistically significant increasing rates.**

The largest increases have been in Delaware, Wisconson, and Minnisota.
